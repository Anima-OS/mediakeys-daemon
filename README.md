mediakeys-daemon
================

Python implementation of Gnome's org.gnome.SettingsDaemon.MediaKeys, for use on other desktop environments.

I forked it from the [original version by arthapex](https://gitorious.org/mediakeys-daemon) to fix some bugs.

It is available under the GNU General Public License, version 2 (GPLv2).
